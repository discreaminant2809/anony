/*!
Provides various anonymous type constructs

# Macros

* [`struct!`]: creates an instance of an anonymous struct.

```rust
use anony::r#struct;

let items = vec![1, 3, 5];

let x = r#struct! {
    name: "discreaminant".to_owned(),
    // move the `items` variable to the struct
    items,
};

assert_eq!(x.name, "discreaminant");
assert_eq!(x.items, [1, 3, 5]);
```

* [`tuple!`]: creates an instance of an anonymous tuple.

```rust
use anony::tuple;

let items = vec![1, 3, 5];

let x = tuple!("discreaminant".to_owned(), items);

assert_eq!(x.0, "discreaminant");
assert_eq!(x.1, [1, 3, 5]);
```

* [`join!`] and [`join_cyclic!`]: join multiple futures. Require `future` feature.

```rust
# futures::executor::block_on(async {
use anony::join;

assert_eq!(join!(async { 2 }, async { "123" }).await, (2, "123"));
# });
```

* [`try_join!`] and [`try_join_cyclic!`]: join multiple futures and short-circuit on "break" value. Require `future` feature.

```rust
# futures::executor::block_on(async {
use anony::try_join;

assert_eq!(try_join!(async { Some(2) }, async { Some("123") }).await, Some((2, "123")));
assert_eq!(try_join!(async { Some(2) }, async { None::<i32> }).await, None);
# });
```

/// Creates an instance of an anonymous struct.
///
/// **Note**: if two instances are created from two different `r#struct!`s, they will guarantee belong to two differences anonymous structs
/// even if they have exactly the same set of fields (both names and types). You can clone an instance instead to get the same
/// fields and type for the cloned instance.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Like how an instance of a normal struct is constructed, you can do the same with this macro:
/// ```
/// use anony::r#struct;
///
/// let address = "123 St. SW";
///
/// let o1 = r#struct! {
///     name: "Alice",
///     age: 28,
///     address,
/// };
///
/// assert_eq!(o1.name, "Alice");
/// assert_eq!(o1.age, 28);
/// assert_eq!(o1.address, "123 St. SW");
///
/// // other anonymous constructs are allowed too!
/// let _o2 = r#struct! {
///     closure: || 3,
///     future: async {
///         let x = "Hello, world!".to_owned();
///         std::future::ready(()).await;
///         x.len()
///     },
///     anonymous: r#struct! {
///         f1: 3.4,
///         f2: Box::new("123"),
///     },
/// };
/// ```
/// You can move fields one by one:
/// ```
/// use anony::r#struct;
///
/// let address = "123 St. SW".to_owned();
///
/// let o1 = r#struct! {
///     name: "Alice".to_owned(),
///     age: 28,
///     address,
/// };
///
/// let name = o1.name;
/// let age = o1.age;
/// let address = o1.address;
///
/// assert_eq!(name, "Alice");
/// assert_eq!(age, 28);
/// assert_eq!(address, "123 St. SW");
/// ```
/// Pinning projection (use `project_ref` for `Pin<&_>` and `project_mut` for `Pin<&mut _>`, like you use `pin-project` crate).
/// The struct created by `project_ref` (not `project_mut`) implements [`Clone`] and [`Copy`]:
/// ```
/// use std::pin::pin;
/// use std::future::Future;
/// use std::task::Context;
/// use std::task::Poll;
/// use anony::r#struct;
/// use futures::task::noop_waker;
///
/// let o1 = r#struct! {
///     fut: async {
///         let s = "10011001001";
///         s.matches("1").count()

/// let mut cx = Context::from_waker(&waker);

/// // Project to the `fut` field
/// assert_eq!(o1.project_mut().fut.poll(&mut cx), Poll::Ready(5));
/// ```
///
/// # Implemented traits
///
/// This struct implements the following if all of its fields are implemented them:
/// * All traits in [`std::cmp`]
/// * [`Debug`]
/// * [`Hash`]
/// * [`Clone`] and [`Copy`] (the cloned instance is guaranteed to have the same type as the source)

/// # Practicality
///
/// For 99.999999999999% of use cases, just use a normal tuple. This macro's only advantages are that it supports pinning projection

/// ```
/// Pinning projection (use `project_ref` for `Pin<&_>` and `project_mut` for `Pin<&mut _>`, like you use `pin-project` crate).
/// They return normal tuples:
/// ```rust
/// use std::pin::pin;

/// use anony::tuple;
/// use futures::task::noop_waker;

/// let mut cx = Context::from_waker(&waker);
///
/// // Project to the first field
/// assert_eq!(o1.project_mut().0.poll(&mut cx), Poll::Ready(5));
